First and foremost, I wish to thank Prof.~Dr.~Armin B.~Cremers for allowing me to write on this self-chosen topic, and for his encouragement and critical questions. A big kudos also to my thesis advisor Daniel Speicher for helping finally find this thesis topic, for his support and guidance, and for his seemingly infinite patience with me during this process.

I'd also like to thank Sebastian Bergmann (the author of the famous PHPUnit), Roman Saul and Christian Kuhn (from the TYPO3 CMS project) who provided feedback, a different perspective and critical questions.

Thanks also go to Melanie Kelter, who mercilessly pointed out my typos and crooked sentences.

I also thank my fellow team members Henning Pingel, Marcus Krause and Helmut Hummel (from the TYPO3 Security Team) who have taught me most of what I know about web application security now.

Thanks also go to my father, who never stopped believing that I would someday finish this thesis (and who kept pushing and nudging me all the time).

Last but not least, I would like to thank Nenad Jovanovic for creating Pixy and PhpParser in the first place, and on whose work this thesis has been built. The saying about ``standing on the shoulders of giants'' concerning Open-Source projects really is true.
