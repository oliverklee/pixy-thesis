First and foremost, I wish to thank my thesis advisor Daniel Speicher for helping finally find this thesis topic, for his support and guidance, and for his seemingly patience with me.

I also thank my fellow team members Henning Pingel, Marcus Krause and Helmut Hummel (from the TYPO3 Security Team) who have taught me most of what I know about web application security now.

Thanks also go to my father, who never stopped believing that I would someday finish this thesis (and who kept pushing and nudging me all the time).

Last but not least I would like to thank Nenad Jovanovic for creating Pixy and PhpParser in the first place, and on whose work this thesis has been built. The saying about ``standing on the shoulders of giants'' concerning Open-Source projects really is true.
