\section{Motivation: Why a Current Static PHP Security Scanner Is Important}
\index{PHP}
At present, there is no free and high-quality static code analysis tool available---and still maintained---that can find vulnerabilities in PHP 5.4.x code. This is a problem because new vulnerabilities in web applications are found almost daily~\cite{osvdb} even in official sites like the German government's site~\cite{xss-bundesregierung}. Furthermore ---as of June 2013---, PHP is used for more than 75 \% of the top-million sites~\cite{w3techs-php-usage}, including Facebook, Wikipedia and WordPress.com~\cite{w3techs-php-sites}. Figure~\ref{fig:php-percentage} shows the percentages of the major server-side programming languages.\index{server-side programming languages}

\section{Research Problems and Approach}

This thesis aims to move the PHP security scanner \bb{Pixy}~(\cite{pixy}, page~\pageref{pixy}) and its subproject \bb{PhpParser}~\cite{phpparser} one big step forward towards being able to scan PHP~5 code and find potential security vulnerabilities that have been made possible with the recent changes in PHP. Particularly, it provides an approach for finding tainted-object-propagation\footnote{See section~\ref{tainted-object-propagation} on page~\pageref{tainted-object-propagation} for details.} vulnerabilities in object fields, for including the fields into Pixy's alias analysis, and for modeling the default pass-by-reference behavior for objects in PHP~5.

In addition, this thesis includes an overview over common vulnerabilities in PHP web applications as well as the theoretical foundation for static code analysis and security scanning.

Code quality\index{code quality} matters. In particular, for an open-source\index{open source} tool like Pixy, code quality is important to attract more contributors to the project. Thus, this thesis also aims at getting Pixy to work with the current Java~7\index{Java 7} without any warnings and at making Pixy's code more maintainable.

These technical goals are mostly necessary due to the fact that the Pixy code base had not been maintained (or even touched) since 2007, yet both PHP (\ie the scanned language) as well as Java (i.e., the scanner's language) had evolved in the meantime.
